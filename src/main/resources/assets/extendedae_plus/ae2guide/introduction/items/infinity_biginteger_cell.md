# Devourer of Cosmic Silence

<ItemImage id="extendedae_plus:infinity_biginteger_cell" scale="4" />

**Devourer of Cosmic Silence** is an ultimate ME storage disk that provides truly infinite item-type support and storage capacity.

## Features

- **Infinite Types**:  
  There is **no limit** to the number of item types it can store.
- **Infinite Capacity**:  
  Storage capacity is based on the **BigInteger** data type, effectively making it limitless.
- **Display Limitation**:  
  Due to AE2’s interface constraints, the ME terminal can display a maximum stored value of **9.2E (9,223,372,036,854,775,808)**.  
  However, the disk **continues to accept items** far beyond this displayed number.
- **Broad Compatibility**:  
  Capable of storing various resources integrated into AE2 via add-on mods (such as *Applied Flux*, *Applied Mekanistics*, etc.), including FE, Mekanism chemicals, Ars Nouveau mana, and more.  
  Storing these resources requires the corresponding add-on mod to be installed.

## Data Security & Recovery

This disk includes a built-in data protection mechanism:
- Use the command `/eap give_infinity_disks` to obtain a copy of the disk corresponding to the saved storage data in the current world.
- This serves as a **failsafe measure**, allowing you to **recover stored data** if the original disk is accidentally lost.
